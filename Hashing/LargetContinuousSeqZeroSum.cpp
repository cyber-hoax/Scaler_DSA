 Given an array A of N integers.

 Find the largest continuous sequence in a array which sums to zero.



 Problem Constraints

 1 <= N <= 106

 -107 <= A[i] <= 107



 Input Format

 Single argument which is an integer array A.



 Output Format

 Return an array denoting the longest continuous sequence with total sum of zero.

 NOTE : If there are multiple correct answers, return the sequence which occurs first in the array.



 Example Input

 A = [1,2,-2,4,-4]


 Example Output

 [2,-2,4,-4]


 Example Explanation

 [2,-2,4,-4] is the longest sequence with total sum of zero.
